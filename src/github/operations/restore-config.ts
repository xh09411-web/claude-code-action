/**
 * Restores security-sensitive config paths from the PR base branch.
 *
 * The CLI's non-interactive mode trusts cwd: it reads `.mcp.json`,
 * `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/settings.local.json` from the working
 * directory and acts on them before any tool-permission gating — executing
 * hooks (including SessionStart), setting env vars (NODE_OPTIONS, LD_PRELOAD,
 * PATH), running apiKeyHelper/awsAuthRefresh shell commands, and auto-approving
 * MCP servers. When this action checks out a PR head, all of these are
 * attacker-controlled.
 *
 * Rather than enumerate every dangerous key, this replaces the entire `.claude/`
 * tree and `.mcp.json` with the versions from the PR base branch, which a
 * maintainer has reviewed and merged. Paths absent on base are deleted.
 *
 * Known limitation: if a PR legitimately modifies `.claude/` and the CLI later
 * commits with `git add -A`, the revert will be included in that commit. This
 * is a narrow UX tradeoff for closing the RCE surface.
 *
 * Only the paths listed in SENSITIVE_PATHS come from the base branch; the rest
 * of the working tree stays at the PR head. A base-branch hook or setting that
 * calls out through files a PR can change — package-manager scripts
 * (`bun run`, `npm run`, `yarn`, `pnpm run`), Makefile or task-runner targets,
 * repo-relative script paths, or tools that load executable project config —
 * therefore runs whatever the PR head provides. Keep restored hooks
 * self-contained: invoke the tool binary directly, pin its version, and pass
 * config on the command line rather than reading it from the checkout. This
 * extends to the runtime itself: `bunx <tool>` runs the tool under `node` when
 * `node` is on PATH, but on a Bun-only runner Bun executes the script and reads
 * `bunfig.toml` (e.g. `preload`) from the checkout, so `bunfig.toml` and
 * `.npmrc` there are PR-controlled runtime config too.
 *
 * @param baseBranch - PR base branch name. Must be pre-validated (branch.ts
 *   calls validateBranchName on it before returning).
 * @returns The paths whose working-tree state now comes from the base branch
 *   rather than the PR. Callers that stage files must exclude these, or they
 *   will commit the revert back onto the PR author's branch.
